# advent-of-code-2023

I plan to use this year's Advent of Code to learn Rust![^1]

Each day recieves its own file, `dayXX.rs`, and can be run with `cargo run (day) (part) (input file)`. The first few days are split into two files because I learned a few days in how to properly structure Rust projects.

Have a wonderful Advent!

[^1]: Due to using Advent of Code as a learning platform, and due to the competitive aspects of Advent of Code priorotizing quick solutions over well-written ones, solutions within this repository may not be high-quality code.
