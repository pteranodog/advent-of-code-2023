# advent-of-code-2023

I plan to use this year's Advent of Code to learn Rust!

Each day recieves its own file, `dayXX.rs`, and can be run with `cargo run (day) (part) (input file)`. The first few days are split into two files because I learned a few days in how to properly structure Rust projects.

Have a wonderful Advent!
